# Flex-SH Ctrl+C Signal Handling Fix

## Problem Summary
On Windows machines, Ctrl+C signals were not properly handled during command execution. The signals would be queued until the current command completed, then all queued Ctrl+C signals would take effect in sequence. This made it impossible to interrupt long-running commands.

## Solution Implemented

### Windows-Specific Improvements
- **Job Objects**: Implemented `WindowsProcessManager` that creates Windows Job Objects for process group management
- **Process Groups**: All child processes are spawned with `CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP` flag
- **Signal Propagation**: Job objects are configured with `JOB_OBJECT_LIMIT_KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE` to terminate entire process trees
- **Immediate Termination**: Uses `tokio::select!` to concurrently wait for process completion and Ctrl+C signals

### Cross-Platform Compatibility  
- **Unix Systems**: Maintains existing SIGINT forwarding behavior using `nix` crate
- **Consistent Exit Codes**: Both platforms return exit code 130 (128 + SIGINT) when interrupted
- **Pipeline Support**: Signal handling works for both single commands and pipelines

## Testing the Fix

### Manual Testing on Windows
1. Build the shell: `cargo build --release`
2. Run the shell: `./target/release/flex-sh`
3. Execute a long-running command: `sleep 30`
4. Press Ctrl+C - the command should terminate immediately
5. Verify exit code is 130

### Manual Testing on Unix/Linux
1. Same steps as Windows
2. Additionally test with: `ping -c 100 localhost`
3. Ctrl+C should immediately terminate the ping command

### Pipeline Testing
1. Run: `sleep 30 | cat`
2. Press Ctrl+C - entire pipeline should terminate
3. Test with: `find / -name "*.txt" 2>/dev/null | head -100`

## Expected Behavior

### Before Fix (Windows)
- Ctrl+C signals queued during command execution
- No interruption until command completes naturally
- All queued Ctrl+C signals then processed in sequence
- Poor user experience with long-running commands

### After Fix (Windows & Unix)
- Immediate response to Ctrl+C during command execution
- Clean termination of child processes and process trees
- Proper exit code (130) returned
- Consistent behavior across platforms

## Technical Details

### Key Files Modified
- `Cargo.toml`: Added Windows API features for job management
- `src/core/executor.rs`: Complete signal handling rewrite
- `src/core/executor_tests.rs`: Unit tests for new functionality

### Windows API Usage
```rust
// Job object creation with kill-on-close
let job_handle = CreateJobObjectW(null, null);
job_info.BasicLimitInformation.LimitFlags = JOB_OBJECT_LIMIT_KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE;
SetInformationJobObject(job_handle, JobObjectExtendedLimitInformation, &job_info);

// Process assignment to job
AssignProcessToJobObject(job_handle, process_handle);

// Termination on Ctrl+C
TerminateJobObject(job_handle, 130);
```

### Cross-Platform Signal Handling
```rust
tokio::select! {
    status = child.wait() => {
        status?.code().unwrap_or(-1)
    }
    _ = signal::ctrl_c() => {
        #[cfg(windows)] {
            self.process_manager.terminate_job()?;
        }
        #[cfg(unix)] {
            kill(Pid::from_raw(child_id), Signal::SIGINT)?;
        }
        130  // Standard interrupted exit code
    }
}
```

This implementation ensures that Ctrl+C works immediately during command execution on both Windows and Unix platforms, providing a consistent and responsive user experience.
